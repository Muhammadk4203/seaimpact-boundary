This project focuses on extracting and plotting boundary data from the SeaImpact Offshore Wind Map. Using Python, 
it reads GeoJSON files that contain wind farm boundaries and turbine locations, converts the geographic coordinates 
to UTM, and visualizes the layout using matplotlib. The goal is to turn the raw boundary data into a usable NumPy 
array format for future applications like simulation, layout planning, or spatial analysis. This script makes it easier 
to work with offshore wind data by providing a clean and accessible way to process and view the boundaries of wind farm zones.
